# Project Name: Safe Entry

## What it does
This project is a web based tool that allows users to preview a cryptocurrency trade and assess its risk before executing it elsewhere. The user enters the asset they are trading from, the asset they are trading to, and the trade size. The system then fetches live market data and produces both a trade preview and a risk score out of 100.

The project was originally prototyped using Discord webhooks to validate the idea quickly. It has since been rebuilt with a web UI to make it easier to use, extend, and demonstrate.

The goal is not to predict price movements or provide financial advice, but to highlight structural risks such as low liquidity, small market capitalisation, or very new tokens.
